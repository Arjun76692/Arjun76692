# Hey! I'm Shivarjun 👋

**MCA Student | Data Analytics Enthusiast | Building stuff with Python & SQL**

I'm a Recent Master of Computer Applications Post-Graduate spending most of my time turning raw data into something useful. I like building complete systems—not just analysis notebooks, but proper pipelines with error handling, logging, and automation.

Currently based in Hyderabad, learning by doing.
